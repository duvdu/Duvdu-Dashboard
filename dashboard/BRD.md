# 2. Feature: User Management

**Objective:**

including verification, communication, and status actions.

## Key Components

```
Component Purpose
Search Bar Quick lookup by Name, Phone, Email, or @Username.
Filter Panel
Filter users by:
```

- **User Type** (Customer, Provider, Admin)
- **Status** (Active, Pending, Suspended)
  **User Table**
  Displays user list with: Name, Email, Type, Status, and quick
  actions.
  **Row Actions** View Profile & Send Notification & Message User

Block Permanently blocks the user from the platform.
Action Log Shows all admin actions on this user with timestamps.
```

## Sub-Feature A: Identity Verification

**Purpose**
Allow admins to individually manage and control each part of user identity verification. Instead of
approving the full profile, admins can approve or disapprove specific items like face photo,
name, email, phone number, or bank account.
‚óè Identity verification is **not a one-time process**. This feature works as an ongoing
**review system**.
‚óè Admins can revisit a user profile at any time and re-evaluate any field.
‚óè For example, while reviewing users, if the admin finds a mismatch (e.g., fake
photo, suspicious bank account), they can disapprove the specific item
immediately.
‚óè The system will then block the related features and notify the user to update that
item.

## Verification Items & Controls

```
Item Admin Control
```

Face Photo Approve / Disapprove selfie or ID image
Full Name Approve / Disapprove (based on consistency)
Email Address Approve / Disapprove
Phone Number Approve / Disapprove
Bank Account Approve / Disapprove (e.g., IBAN review)
Each item has its own status: **Approved / Disapproved / Pending**

## System Behavior on Disapproval

When any required item is disapproved:
‚óè The user is blocked from related features (e.g., booking, payout, account access).
‚óè The user receives an auto-notification: ‚ÄúYour [item] was rejected. Please update it to
continue using the platform.‚Äù

## User Flow

```
‚óè User uploads verification data: face image, name, email, phone, bank.
‚óè Admin opens the Identity Verification tab in the user‚Äôs profile.
‚óè Admin reviews and approves/disapproves each item separately.
‚óè If any item is disapproved:
‚óã Admin optionally adds a reason.
‚óã The system sends a notification.
‚óã Access is restricted.
```

## Sub-Feature B: Payout Method Management
