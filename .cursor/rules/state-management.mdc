# State Management Guidelines

- Use Zustand for global state management.
- The main auth/session store is in [src/features/auth/store.ts](mdc:src/features/auth/store.ts).
- Avoid introducing other state management libraries unless absolutely necessary.
- Use the `useAuthStore` hook to access and update authentication/session state throughout the app.
