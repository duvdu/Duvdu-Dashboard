- All forms should use shadcn UI form components, integrated with react-hook-form for state management and submission.
- Use zod for form validation.
- Validation schemas must be created under a `schemas/` folder within the relevant feature/module directory (e.g., `login.schema.ts`).
- Always import and use the schema for validation with react-hook-form's resolver.
